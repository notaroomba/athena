## 11/2/2025 - Fixed USB Hub Spec / Misc Problems / LED Problems  

![IMG-20251028-WA0024](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjMxMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--41850544da3487ad6cffc63088dd5dafacfb3717/IMG-20251028-WA0024.jpg)

So my board finally came in and there were a few problems...

First of all was that when making the USB Hub I had some 15K pulldown resistors as I followed the schematic. Then when I was revising it a month later before I ordered it, I marked them as DNP and removed the pads... (subtle foreshadowing)

When It finally arrived, I connected it to USB-C and nothing happened. I assume it was because I havent configured USB-PD yet. Then I decided to connect a 1s LiPo battery and it finally connected to my laptop. The only problem was that it didn't recognize the 3 STM32's that I had placed. It was only a few hours later after debugging that I noticed why... (BECAUSE OF THE DNP RESISTORS)

Finally when I pressed the boot button, the entire board "reset" and it disconnected and reconnected to my computer... Revising the PCB...

...the definition of fucking around and finding out

Now that I have succesfully identified both problems with my board, I set out to fix them. The only problem is, I didn't know how to solder so I tore open a wifi router that was unused and practiced soldering and desoldering 0603 and 0402 components for a few days. This because I was planning on buying some resistors online and soldering it myself.

After running out of allowance on customs and tariffs, I couldn't order SMD resistors and then had to go downtown and find some, but I couldn't find any so I settled for normal resistors (Through Hole). After receiving the resistors I now was faced with the horror of soldering so I asked a friend if they could lend me their fine tipped soldering iron/magnifying glass and got to work.

The result after a little help and a bunch of youtube tutorials...

I still have another PCB to do but I am going to wait to order the SMD resistors so it looks prettier. I then had to desolder the GND pin of the button, raise it up a little, and then tried to solder a thin copper connecting the resistor to the button correctly, after a few failed attempts I finally got something that didn't cause a short. I put a little piece of sandpaper under so that the button wouldn't fall down again when pressed and cause another short lol.

(its the second button that looks a little raised)

Now I could finally start to program! I plugged in the battery and finally my computer detected it as 3 STM32's, also the SPU's status light turned green because I'm assuming for the UART conenction:

I started working on turning on the LED's but couldn't get them to change so I went to sleep. The next day when I tried to turn on the board, I connected the battery and no lights came on. I pulled out my multimeter and after a few hours of debugging I realized that the 3.3V buck converter wasn't turning on so I assumed it was the battery, after putting 2 battery cells in series the board turned on. So then I decided to take 2 old batter cells from old walkie talkies and I charged them and then soldered them in series and connected them to the board.

After that I started to program and got the MCU to blink a white light. I'm still having issues changing the lights so I'm going to work on that.
